      <font size="6"><p>Using the MIT App Inventor, we were able to create the classic tic tac toe game.<br>
      Play tic tac toe against your friends! Press the buttons to place your mark. First to get three in a row wins.<br>
      The game detects each button press and counts off which player is pressing the button so it alternates between an "X" and an "O".<br>
      Once a player has gotten three in a row, the game will tell you who won!<br>
      To install the game, click the image and save the apk file to your computer. Install to your device, and you're ready to play!</p></font>
