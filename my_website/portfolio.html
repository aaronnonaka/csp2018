      <font size="6"><p><font face="Arial">Using the MIT App Inventor, we were able to create the classic tic tac toe game.
       Play tic tac toe against your friends! Press the buttons to place your mark. First to get three in a row wins.
       The game detects each button press and counts off which player is pressing the button so it alternates between an "X" and an "O".
       Once a player has gotten three in a row, the game will tell you who won!
       To install the game, click the image and save the apk file to your computer. Install to your device, and you're ready to play!</font></p></font>

       The process continues on a loop until the user is finished. Click the image to download the Canopy file and try it out.</font></p></font>

      By resizing the bunny to be proportional to the chair, as well as finding the correct location to paste the bunny on to the chair image, I was able to create my new image.
      I also detected whenever the chair background was white, and changed the pixels that were white to a new color.</font></p></font>
